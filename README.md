# Packages

Vue front-end and strapi back-end


# Purpose

This Reposetory has been made to show my approach on creating a simple todo list and fetching Data from a back-end Server with the methods, GET, POST, DELETE

# What I want to improve

in future bigger Projects, I definetly want to improve Data-structure and cleaning up the Code. 
This was my first time working with Strapi and Vue, though through my expirience with React and React-native it was pretty easy to Understand and the Documentations from Vue and Strapi were a good source to get familiar with the Syntax. 

# Goal for this Repository

As mentioned my Goal was to simply make a few fetch requests and creating a reference for the Code of my first Strapi-Vue Application. I definetly would need to clean up Code in my functions and structure my Components better, like I do in my React and React-native Projects. The Goal of having a working Todo-list is achieved but this Code should be seen as a reference on my progress after working with vue and strapi for 3-4 days. 

# Future

I definetly also want to upload a reposetory of a Project where I have a clean Code and a proper structure in my Component folder. This will properly be a React-Native Project because I simply have a lot of expirience with that Frame-work and I also want to have a reference for a Project where I implement all of the knowledge I gained in the time I started working and learning in Web-developement.
